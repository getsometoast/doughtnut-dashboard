# SANDBOX
The whole point of this is to have an area where I can spike stuff out without affecting the application, I don't use testing in here as it's predominantely for acquiring knowledge.  This is not deployed to production.

I use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to provide a mock backend to rapidly test out differnet component / state interactions that require a backend api.

## Example Pages:
- [CRUD Example](crudExample/README.md): page with some components to perform CRUD operations with a backend
- [Layout Example](layoutExample/README.md): page with a common app layout
- [Char Example](chartExample/README.md): page with some example charts and data visualisations
