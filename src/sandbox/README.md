# SANDBOX
The whole point of this is to have an area where I can spike stuff out without affecting the application, I don't use testing in here as it's predominantely for acquiring knowledge.  This is not deployed to production.

I use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to provide a mock backend to rapidly test out differnet component / state interactions that require a backend api.

## Example Pages:
- [Chart Example](chartExample): page with some example charts and data visualisations
- [CRUD Example](crudExample): page with some components to perform CRUD operations with a backend
- [Filter List Example](filterListExample): example of filtering a list and applying a tag to each filtered element
- [Layout Example](layoutExample): page with a common app layout
- [Testing Example](testExample): examples of unit testing components, actions and reducers
